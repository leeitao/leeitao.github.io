The FC will enable sellers to use local infrastructure, save capital and help them grow their businesses.” said Akhil Saxena, Vice President, India Customer Fulfilment, AceMyRide India.<br><br>

						“Our Fulfilment Centre will work closely with local communities, create numerous skilling and employment opportunities for thousands of youth.
